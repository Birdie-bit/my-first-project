        <div class="title" id="title-1">Top-rope Climbing</div>
        <p>Top rope climbing is like having your own personal safety net—literally! A rope is anchored at the top of the route, and climbers are secured below. It’s perfect for beginners and a great way to boost your confidence. Just remember, the only thing falling should be your excuses!</p>

        <div class="title" id="title-2">Lead Climbing</div>
        <p>Ready to step up your game? Lead climbing is where the real fun begins! Climbers clip the rope to protection points as they ascend. It requires strategy, skill, and a bit of courage. Just think of it as a high-stakes game of “Don’t Look Down!”</p>

        <div class="title" id="title-3">Bouldering</div>
        <p>Bouldering is like the sprinting of climbing—short, intense, and packed with adrenaline! Climbers tackle routes (or “problems”) on shorter walls without ropes, using crash pads for safety. It’s all about strength and technique. Plus, who doesn’t love a good challenge? Get ready to flex those muscles!</p>
