<div>
	<p> Top-rope climbing is a style where the climber ascends a route with the rope anchored at the top. The rope runs from the climber, through an anchor at the top of the route, and back down to a belayer at the base. This setup allows for a safer experience, as the climber is always protected from falls. Top-rope climbing is ideal for beginners and helps build confidence while mastering climbing techniques.</p>
<h2 style="color: #AAEAAA; font-size: 20px; text-align: left;"> Lead Climbing </h2>
<div>
<p>Lead climbing is a style where the climber ascends a route while attaching themselves to fixed protection points, such as bolts, using a rope. Unlike top-rope climbing, the rope is not pre-attached at the top, making it essential for climbers to clip into quickdraws as they go. This method allows for longer and more challenging climbs, requiring both skill and communication between the climber and belayer.
