             <h2 class="title" id="title-1"> Top-rope Climbing </h2>
             <p> Top rope climbing is like having your own personal safety net—literally! The rope is anchored at the top, with a belayer keeping things secure on the ground. It's perfect for beginners because you can focus on climbing without worrying about big falls. All the safety is already set up, so you just have to trust the rope, your belayer, and yourself</p>

             <h2 class="title" id="title-2"> Lead Climbing </h2>
             <p> Lead climbing is where the real fun starts! Unlike top rope, you’re responsible for clipping the rope into protection points as you climb. It takes strategy, solid technique, and a bit of courage, like a high-stakes game of "Don’t Look Down!" While it gives you more freedom, it also comes with more responsibility—you’ve got to stay sharp, clip wisely, and manage your energy. Perfect for when you’re ready to push yourself and tackle bigger challenges! </p>

             <h2 class="title" id="title-3"> Bouldering </h2>
             <p> Bouldering is like the sprinting of climbing—short, intense, and packed with adrenaline! Climbers tackle routes on shorter walls without ropes, using crash pads for safety. It’s all about strength and technique.</p>
