            <h2 class="title" id="title-1">Top-rope Climbing</h2>
            <p>Top rope climbing is like having your own personal safety net—literally! The rope is anchored at the top, with a belayer keeping things secure on the ground. It's perfect for beginners because you can focus on climbing without worrying about big falls. All the safety is already set up, so you just have to trust the rope, your belayer, and yourself.</p>

            <h2 class="title" id="title-2">Lead Climbing</h2>
            <p>Lead climbing is where the real fun begins! Unlike top rope, you clip the rope into protection points as you climb. It takes strategy, solid technique, and a bit of courage—like a high-stakes game of "Don’t Look Down!" With more freedom comes more responsibility, so you need to stay focused, clip efficiently, and manage your energy.</p>

            <h2 class="title" id="title-3">Bouldering</h2>
            <p>Bouldering is climbing’s short-and-sweet challenge—no ropes, just you, the wall, and crash pads below. Climbers scale shorter walls, focusing on raw strength, technique, and problem-solving. It’s fast-paced, intense, and perfect for testing your limits in a few power-packed moves!</p>
